Exercise 35: Branches and Functions
===================================

You have learned to do ``if-statements``, functions, and arrays. Now
it's time to bend your mind. Type this in, and see if you can figure out
what it's doing.

.. literalinclude:: ex/ex35.rb
    :language: ruby
    :linenos:

What You Should See
-------------------

Here's me playing the game:

::

    $ ruby ex35.rb
    You are in a dark room.
    There is a door to your right and left.
    Which one do you take?
    > left
    There is a bear here.
    The bear has a bunch of honey.
    The fat bear is in front of another door.
    How are you going to move the bear?
    > taunt bear
    The bear has moved from the door. You can go through it now.
    > open door
    This room is full of gold.  How much do you take?
    > asf
    Man, learn to type a number. Good job!
    $

Extra Credit
------------

1. Draw a map of the game and how you flow through it.
2. Fix all of your mistakes, including spelling mistakes.
3. Write comments for the functions you do not understand. Remember
   **RDoc** comments?
4. Add more to the game. What can you do to both simplify and expand it.
5. The ``gold_room`` has a weird way of getting you to type a number.
   What are all the bugs in this way of doing it? Can you make it better
   than just checking if "1" or "0" are in the number? Look at how
   ``to_i()`` works for clues.
