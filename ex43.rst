Exercise 43: Gothons From Planet Percal #25
*******************************************

.. warning:: This is being rewritten based on the Python version, there may be errors.

Here is a new game, using what you've learned so far and some
new tricks.

.. literalinclude:: ex/ex43.rb
    :language: ruby
    :linenos:

It's a lot of code, but go through it, make sure it works, play it.


What You Should See
===================

Here's me playing the game.

.. literalinclude:: ex/ex43.txt
    :language: console



Extra Credit
============

1.  Explain how returning the next room works.
2.  Add cheat codes to the game so you can get past the more difficult rooms.  I can do this with two words on one line.
3.  Instead of having each function print itself, learn about "doc string" style comments.
    Write the room description as doc comments, and change the runner to print them.
4.  Once you have doc comments as the room description, do you need to have the
    function prompt even?  Have the runner prompt the user, and pass that in to
    each function.  Your functions should just be if-statements printing the
    result and returning the next room.
5.  This is actually a small version of something called a "finite state machine".
    Read about them.  They might not make sense but try anyway.
6.  I have a bug in this code. Why is the door lock guessing 11 times?
