Exercise 24: More Practice
==========================

You are getting to the end of this section. You should have enough Ruby
"under your fingers" to move onto learning about how programming really
works, but you should do some more practice. This exercise is longer and
all about building up stamina. The next exercise will be similar. Do
them, get them exactly right, and do your checks.

    This should be five: 5
    With a starting point of: 10000
    We'd have 5000000 beans, 5000 jars, and 50 crates.
    We can also do that this way:

Extra Credit
------------

1. Make sure to do your checks: read it backwards, read it out loud, put
   comments above confusing parts.
2. Break the file on purpose, then run it to see what kinds of errors
   you get. Make sure you can fix it.
