Exercise 51: Getting Input From A Browser
=========================================

While it's exciting to see the browser display "Hello World", it's even
more exciting to let the user submit text to your application from a
form. In this exercise we'll improve our starter web application using
forms and figure out how to do automated testing for a web application.

How The Web Works
-----------------

Time for some boring stuff. You need to understand a bit more about how
the web works before you can make a form. This description isn't
complete, but it's accurate and will help you figure out what might be
going wrong with your application. Also, creating forms will be easier
if you know what they do.

I'll start with a simple diagram that shows you the different parts of a
web request and how the information flows:

   http request diagram


I've labeled the lines with letters so I can walk you through a regular
request process:

1. You type in the url http://learnpythonthehardway.org/ into your
   browser and it sends the request out on ``line (A)`` to your
   computer's network interface.
2. Your request goes out over the internet on ``line (B)`` and then to
   the remote computer on ``line (C)`` where my server accepts the
   request.
3. Once my computer accepts it, my web application gets it on
   ``line (D)``, and my web application code runs the ``/`` (index)
   handler.
4. The response comes out of my web server when I return it, and goes
   back to your browser over ``line (D)`` again.
5. The server running this site takes the response off ``line (D)`` then
   sends it back over the internet on ``line (C)``.
6. The response from the server then comes off the internet on
   ``line (B)``, and your computer's network interface hands it to your
   browser on ``line (A)``.
7. Finally, your browser then displays the response.

In this description there are a few terms you should know so that you
have a common vocabulary to work with when talking about your web
application:

Browser
~~~~~~~

The software that you're probably using every day. Most people don't
know what it really does, they just call it "the internet". Its job is
to take addresses (like http://learnpythonthehardway.org) you type into
the URL bar, then use that information to make requests to the server at
that address.

Address
~~~~~~~

This is normally a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) like
http://learnpythonthehardway.org/ and indicates where a browser should
go. The first part ``http`` indicates the protocol you want to use, in
this case "Hyper-Text Transport Protocol". You can also try
ftp://ibiblio.org/ to see how "File Transport Protocol" works. The
``learnpythonthehardway.org`` part is the "hostname", or a human
readable address you can remember and which maps to a number called an
IP address, similar to a telephone number for a computer on the
Internet. Finally, URLs can have a trailing ``path`` like the ``/book/``
part of http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ which indicates a file or
some resource *on* the server to retrieve with a request. There are many
other parts, but those are the main ones.

Connection
~~~~~~~~~~

Once a browser knows what protocol you want to use (http), what server
you want to talk to (learnpythonthehardway.org), and what resource on
that server to get, it must make a connection. The browser simply asks
your Operating System (OS) to open a "port" to the computer, usually
port 80. When it works the OS hands back to your program something that
works like a file, but is actually sending and receiving bytes over the
network wires between your computer and the other computer at
"learnpythonthehardway.org". This is also the same thing that happens
with http://localhost:8080/ but in this case you're telling the browser
to connect to your own computer (localhost) and use port 4567 rather
than the default of 80. You could also do
http://learnpythonthehardway.org:80/ and get the same result, except
you're explicitly saying to use port 80 instead of letting it be that by
default.

Request
~~~~~~~

Your browser is connected using the address you gave. Now it needs to
ask for the resource it wants (or you want) on the remote server. If you
gave ``/book/`` at the end of the URL, then you want the file (resource)
at ``/book/``, and most servers will use the real file
``/book/index.html`` but pretend it doesn't exist. What the browser does
to get this resource is send a request to the server. I won't get into
exactly how it does this, but just understand that it has to send
something to query the server for the request. The interesting thing is
that these "resources" don't have to be files. For instance, when the
browser in your application asks for something, the server is returning
something your code generated.

Server
~~~~~~

The server is the computer at the end of a browser's connection that
knows how to answer your browser's requests for files/resources. Most
web servers just send files, and that's actually the majority of
traffic. But you're actually building a server in Ruby that knows how to
take requests for resources, and then return strings that you craft
using Ruby. When you do this crafting, *you* are pretending to be a file
to the browser, but really it's just code. As you can see from Ex. 50,
it also doesn't take much code to create a response.

Response
~~~~~~~~

This is the HTML (css, javascript, or images) your server wants to send
back to the browser as the answer to the browser's request. In the case
of files, it just reads them off the disk and sends them to the browser,
but it wraps the contents of the disk in a special "header" so the
browser knows what it's getting. In the case of your application, you're
still sending the same thing, including the header, but you generate
that data on the fly with your Ruby code.

That is the fastest crash course in how a web browser accesses
information on servers on the internet. It should work well enough for
you to understand this exercise, but if not, read about it as much as
you can until you get it. A really good way to do that is to take the
diagram, and break different parts of the web application you did in
Exercise 50. If you can break your web application in predictable ways
using the diagram, you'll start to understand how it works.

How Forms Work
--------------

The best way to play with forms is to write some code that accepts form
data, and then see what you can do. Take your ``lib/gothonweb.rb`` file
and make it look like this:

.. literalinclude:: ex/ex51/gothonweb/lib/gothonweb_1.rb
    :language: ruby
    :linenos:

Restart Sinatra (hit CTRL-C and then run it again) to make sure it loads
again, then with your browser go to ``http://localhost:4567/hello``
which should display, "I just wanted to say Hello, Nobody." Next, change
the URL in your browser to ``http://localhost:4567/hello?name=Frank``
and you'll see it say "Hello, Frank." Finally, change the ``name=Frank``
part to be your name. Now it's saying hello to you.

Let's break down the changes I made to your script.

1. Instead of just a string for greeting I'm now using the ``params``
   hash to get data from the browser. Sinatra takes all of the key/value
   pairs after the ``?`` part of the URL and adds them to the ``params``
   hash for you to work with.
2. I then construct the ``greeting`` from the ``name`` value we
   extracted via the ``params[:name]`` hash lookup, which should be very
   familiar to you by now.
3. Everything else about the file is the same as before.

You're also not restricted to just one parameter on the URL. Change this
example to give two variables like this:
``http://localhost:4567/hello?name=Frank&greet=Hola``. Then change the
code to get ``params[:name]`` and ``params[:greet]`` like this:

.. code-block:: ruby

     greeting = "#{greet}, #{name}" 

Creating HTML Forms
-------------------

Passing the parameters on the URL works, but it's kind of ugly and not
easy to use for regular people. What you really want is a "POST form",
which is a special HTML file that has a ``<form>`` tag in it. This form
will collect information from the user, then send it to your web
application just like you did above.

Let's make a quick one so you can see how it works. Here's the new HTML
file you need to create, in ``lib/views/hello_form.erb``:

.. literalinclude:: ex/ex51/gothonweb/lib/views/hello_form_1.erb
    :language: erb
    :linenos:

You should then change ``lib/gothonweb.rb`` to look like this:

.. literalinclude:: ex/ex51/gothonweb/lib/gothonweb.rb
    :language: ruby
    :linenos:

Once you've got those written up, simply restart the web application
again and hit it with your browser like before.

This time you'll get a form asking you for "A Greeting" and "Your Name".
When you hit the Submit button on the form, it will give you the same
greeting you normally get, but this time look at the URL in your
browser. See how it's ``http://localhost:4567/hello`` even though you
sent in parameters.

The part of the ``hello_form.erb`` file that makes this work is the line
with ``<form action="/hello" method="POST">``. This tells your browser
to:

1. Collect data from the user using the form fields inside the form.
2. Send them to the server using a POST type of request, which is just
   another browser request that "hides" the form fields.
3. Send that to the ``/hello`` URL (as shown in the ``action="/hello"``
   part).
4. You can then see how the two ``<input>`` tags match the names of the
   variables in your new code. Also notice that instead of just a GET
   method inside class index, I have another method POST.

How this new application works is:

1. The browser first hits the web application at ``/hello`` but it sends
   a GET, so our ``get '/hello/'`` block runs and returns the
   ``hello_form``.
2. You fill out the form in the browser, and the browser does what the
   ``<form>`` says and sends the data as a POST.
3. The web application then runs the ``post '/hello'`` block rather than
   the ``get '/hello'`` block to handle this request.
4. This ``post '/hello'`` block then does what it normally does to send
   back the ``hello`` page like before. There's really nothing new in
   here, it's just moved into a new block.

As an exercise, go into the ``lib/views/index.erb`` file and add a link
back to just ``/hello`` so that you can keep filling out the form and
seeing the results. Make sure you can explain how this link works and
how it's letting you cycle between ``lib/views/index.erb`` and
``lib/views/hello_form.erb`` and what's being run inside this latest
Ruby code.

Creating A Layout Template
--------------------------

When you work on your game in the next Exercise, you'll need to make a
bunch of little HTML pages. Writing a full web page each time will
quickly become tedious. Luckily you can create a "layout" template, or a
kind of shell that will wrap all your other pages with common headers
and footers. Good programmers try to reduce repetition, so layouts are
essential for being a good programmer.

Change ``lib/views/index.erb`` to be like this:

.. literalinclude:: ex/ex51/gothonweb/lib/views/index.erb
    :language: erb
    :linenos:

Change ``lib/views/hello_form.erb`` to be like this:

.. literalinclude:: ex/ex51/gothonweb/lib/views/hello_form.erb
    :language: erb
    :linenos:

All we're doing is stripping out the "boilerplate" at the top and the
bottom which is always on every page. We'll put that back into a single
``lib/views/layout.erb`` file that handles it for us from now on.

Once you have those changes, create a ``lib/views/layout.erb`` file with
this in it:

.. literalinclude:: ex/ex51/gothonweb/lib/views/layout.erb
    :language: erb
    :linenos:

Sinatra automatically looks for a layout template called ``layout`` by
default to use as the *base* template for all other templates. You can
customize which template is used as the base for any given page, too.
Restart your application and then try to change the layout in
interesting ways, but without changing the other templates.

Writing Automated Tests For Forms
---------------------------------

It's easy to test a web application with your browser by just hitting
refresh, but come on, we're programmers here. Why do some repetitive
task when we can write some code to test our application? What you're
going to do next is write a little test for your web application form
based on what you learned in Exercise 47. If you don't remember Exercise
47, read it again.

I've created a simple little function for that lets you assert things
about your web application's response, aptly named ``assert_response``.
Create the file ``test/test_gothonweb.rb`` with these contents:

.. literalinclude:: ex/ex51/gothonweb/test/test_gothonweb.rb
    :language: ruby
    :linenos:

Finally, run ``test/test_gothonweb.rb`` to test your web application:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ruby test/test_gothonweb.rb 
    Loaded suite test/test_gothonweb
    Started
    .
    Finished in 0.023839 seconds.

    1 tests, 9 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips

    Test run options: --seed 57414


What I'm doing here is I'm actually importing the whole application from
the ``lib/gothonweb.rb`` library, then running it manually.

The ``rack/test`` library we have included has a very simple API for
processing requests. Its ``get``, ``put``, ``post``, ``delete``, and
``head`` methods simulate the respective type of request on the
application.

All mock request methods have the same argument signature:

.. code-block:: ruby

    get '/path', params={}, rack\_env={} 


-  ``/path`` is the request path and may optionally include a query
   string.
-  ``params`` is a Hash of query/post parameters, a String request body,
   or nil.
-  ``rack_env`` is a Hash of Rack environment values. This can be used
   to set request headers and other request related information, such as
   session data.

This works without running an actual web server so you can do tests with
automated tests and also use your browser to test a running server.

To validate responses from this function, use the ``assert_response``
function from ``test/test_gothonweb.rb`` which has:

.. code-block:: ruby

    assert_response(resp, contains=nil, matches=nil, headers=nil, status=200) 

Pass in the response you get from calling ``get`` or ``post`` then add
things you want checked. Use the ``contains`` parameter to make sure
that the response contains certain values. Use the ``status`` parameter
to check for certain responses. There's actually quite a lot of
information in this little function so it would be good for you to study
it.

In the ``test/test_gothonweb.rb`` automated test I'm first making sure
the ``/foo`` URL returns a "404 Not Found" response, since it actually
doesn't exist. Then I'm checking that ``/hello`` works with both a GET
and POST form. Following the test should be fairly simple, even if you
might not totally know what's going on.

Take some time studying this latest application, especially how the
automated testing works.

Extra Credit
------------

1. Read even more about HTML, and give the simple form a better layout.
   It helps to draw what you want to do on paper and *then* implement it
   with HTML.
2. This one is hard, but try to figure out how you'd do a file upload
   form so that you can upload an image and save it to the disk.
3. This is even more mind-numbing, but go find the HTTP RFC (which is
   the document that describes how HTTP works) and read as much of it as
   you can. It is really boring, but comes in handy once in a while.
4. This will also be really difficult, but see if you can find someone
   to help you setup a web server like Apache, Nginx, or thttpd. Try to
   serve a couple of your .html and .css files with it just to see if
   you can. Don't worry if you can't, web servers kind of suck.
5. Take a break after this and just try making as many different web
   applications as you can. You should definitely read about sessions in
   Sinatra so you can understand how to keep state for a user.
